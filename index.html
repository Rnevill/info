	<p>Will Bryant is an artist, designer, and illustrator based in Austin, Texas. <br>He would like to think that he makes fun, exuberant, and sometimes humorous work. <br>In addition to collaborating with brands, he also continues to develop a body <br>of work in the form of painting, drawing, printmaking, and sculpture. <br><br>

Growing up in Texarkana, TX he spent his time playing sports, watching Pee Weeâ€™s Playhouse, and making lame jokes. Some things never change.
<br><br>
He studied graphic design at Mississippi State University (2008) and received an MFA in <br>Contemporary Art Practice from Portland State University (2013).
